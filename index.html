                        <h6>By Stuart Steinberg, Chief Operating Officer</h6>
                        <p>Concord is pleased to announce that we have fallen in love with our Beverly Hills location and have decided to stay long term.
                            Originally, this office was to be temporary while we relocated from Century City to a building that we own in syndication in the process of renovation in Los Angeles.  In the interim, this convenient location and beautiful Beverly Hills neighborhood have come to feel like home.  We believe it’s the best place for us to welcome our clients and the perfect headquarters for providing unparalleled service as we continue to help property owners achieve their real estate goals.
                             In true Concord style, Concord’s construction division will be completing our own tenant improvements. Soon after, we plan to celebrate the grand opening with clients, friends and family.</p>

                        <h2>DEAL STORY: Relationships Turn an Unlikely Deal Into an Extraordinary One</h2>
                        <h6>By Yoav Sarraf, Managing Director and Cecille Maristela, Director / Construction Services</h6>
                        <p>Every property and investment opportunity is unique. Managing a complex deal that serves all parties in involved is truly rewarding. It takes some teamwork, creative and strategic thinking, strong relationships, and, I think, a special brokerage. </p>
                        <h4>The Property</h4>
                        <p>The property at the center of this deal is on 3rd Street near Crescent Heights. At the time, I was actually representing another property. But I’d begun developing a relationship with the owner of the two-story, owner-user office building next door. The gentleman who owned the property had some thoughts about selling, but he was reluctant to take it to market. Still, he mentioned he would consider an offer for the property if I could introduce the right buyer. Fortunately, I was working with an investment group at the time that I believed would be an excellent fit. We started negotiating an offer.”</p>
                        <p>What seemed to be proceeding easily enough turned in to a long negotiation process met with many financing challenges. After exploring several options and traveling down numerous roads, I came up with a solution I thought might be a viable solution. I asked the owner if he’d consider holding the loan. The answer was, yes. I was able to craft a mutually agreeable loan structure, successfully negotiate the deal, and close escrow. </p>
                        <p>As it stood, the property was built for office use. It was occupied and had been leased out for peace and justice causes. However, the owner had master lease on the property. So, he was able to relocate the current tenants to another building and deliver the property vacant. </p>
                        <p>All of that was step one.  </p>
                        <h4>Highest & Best Use</h4>
                        <p>Concord Real Estate is built to facilitate a project from beginning to end and I, of course, wanted to deliver maximum possible value for the client and future tenants. The next thing we needed to do was determine the highest and best use for the property. </p>
                        <p>Office use did not seem ideal. In my experience, for that area, I felt it was best to convert the building to mixed use—offices above and 1-2 retail tenants below. </p>
                        <p>The new owner and I then turned to Concord’s Construction division. They consulted on the remodel while we began marketing the retail space below. I used traditional marketing as well as a highly targeted strategy and reached out for tenants that would ideally fit the character of the street and the building. </p>
                        <p>There was a tremendous amount of interest. And again, we explored a lot of avenues. But, as often happens, it’s relationships that make business happen. Our construction division had elected to work with an architecture group with whom I’d also developed a relationship. And the downstairs retail tenant—an established restaurateur—originated from that connection. I negotiated a lease with a restaurant tenant and provided ideas and direction for the remodel that fitted the space for restaurant occupancy. </p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, I marketed and negotiated the lease for the new office space upstairs and then worked with the new tenants toward their building improvements. By the end, it was a complete remodel. </p>
                        <h4>Final Evaluation</h4>
                        <p>It was a long, complex project that took a ton of work and some outside-the-box thinking. A beginning to end project that began with a relationship and a little exploration. That’s what makes it so rewarding and why I love working within a comprehensive real estate service like Concord. </p>
                        <p>When you have relationships with people you work well with, you have that trust. And then, with a little creativity and some sweat, you can almost always find a way to get a deal done that benefits all. From a building whose owner wasn’t committed to selling to a purchase and remodel that completely changed the direction of a property and brought it to highest and best use—doesn’t get much better than that.</p>

                        <h2>CHANGE IS ELECTRIC</h2>
                        <h6>By Aric Ohana, Director, Management Services</h6>
                        <p>You might have seen our fleet of bright-orange, electric Fiats driving around Los Angeles branded with the Concord Real Estate logo. If you have, then you’ve had a glimpse at what we feel is one of the most impactful services to hit property management in a long time. We call it Mobile Manager. And as Concord Real Estate’s Director of Asset & Property Management Services, I’m excited at the potential to disrupt how the industry operates. Though I hate to use the word “disruptive” to describe something that is as helpful and cost-saving as Mobile Manager.
                            What is Mobile Manager? It’s a service that is of great help to property managers, owners, and renters. Each of our Mobile Manager Fiats is outfitted with a mini (pun intended) mobile office. Pop the trunk and you have a tablet equipped with the AppFolio cloud filing system, scanner, copier, printer, and pop-out standing desk. And because it’s well-branded with company logo and colors, they also have the extra benefit of serving as an additional marketing platform.
                            The choice to go with clean-energy, electric cars is part of our initiative to be green. But the driving force was to reduce waste of our most expensive resource—the time of our employees. Now, while they’re on the go, our managers can meet up with tenants, collect rent, process applications, print leases, and submit work orders without leaving their curbside parking spot. Because they don’t have to go back and forth to the office, they spend more time in the field doing what’s most important.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <p>Some of the improved user experiences provided by Mobile Manager include:</p>
                            <li>Free online rent payments via checking account</li>
                            <li>Ability to make rent payment via credit card or at any 7-11 or Ace Cash</li>
                            <li>Mobile rental application submission and resident screening</li>
                            <li>Instant, onsite property inspection and reporting</li>
                            <li>A 24/7 property management answering service</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            With Mobile Manager, we can run a leaner operation, which saves costs, and still be more effective than ever before. And we don’t charge our clients for this new feature. The efficiency and savings of Mobile Manager is passed on to them. This isn’t an add-value—this is what real estate property management should be. People in today’s innovative world have higher expectations, and we’re simply raising the bar to meet them. Exceed them if we can.

                        <h2>UNDUE DILLIGENCE</h2>
                        <h6>By Guillermo Ma, Managing Director</h6>
                        <p>In all my years in the business, due diligence has meant taking care to prevent avoidable mistakes and make sure my clients don’t get hurt. I even looked it up in the dictionary. Pretty much says the same there. Yet current market conditions are bending the meaning and purpose of due diligence.</p>
                        <p>It’s not entirely unexpected that hotly competitive markets are driving buyers to forgo necessary steps and precautions in order to make a deal happen. But due diligence is not a concept to be tossed out the window lightly. If buyers are going to rush to close, they had better be expecting, and ready for, the potential consequences.</p>
                        <h4>Buyers must compete </h4>
                        <p>Good property in good locations are generally receiving a slew of offers. Buyers are forced to find ways to make their offers more compelling. And as Arleen Jacobius pointed out in her report on The Real Estate & Bank General Counsel Forum: Due diligence timelines are speeding up. She quotes Neil Klien of IndCor Properties as stating that in 2012 and 2013 due diligence periods accelerated to what “lawyers and due diligence people would think were borderline crazy” and that reducing time for due diligence is “self-inflicted risk.”</p>
                        <h4>The new norm</h4>
                        <p>One of the ways to buyers are sweetening their offers is to take some balls out of the air that can slow down the deal. They cut out contingencies. Non-contingent offers are becoming more and more common. </p>
                        <h4>On your mark, close your eyes, go</h4>
                        <p>’ve recently seen highly competitive situations that required the release of money on acceptance of a contract. A short due diligence time followed. But can you really call it due diligence if you already handed over the money? I don’t know. Now, maybe your business and investment strategy is built to handle the risk. But racing forward with a blindfold on leaves you exposed. It’s more like racing forward with a blindfold buck naked. You’re going to run into something out there. And it’s going to hurt. </p>
                        <h4>Loan contingencies? </h4>
                        <p>Non existent.</p>
                        <h4>Healthier Market = Health Risks</h4>
                        <p>Loan regulations have helped make it safer environment. Which has boosted confidence in trading. Which has in turn led to a healthier market. So it’s ironic that investors have been lured back into the safer market only to find themselves forced to take unhealthy risks. Risks like signing off on Books & Records without proper review. Mistakes are going to be made that not only lead to poor investment decisions, but also to legal disputes and financial loss for all involved: buyers, sellers, agents, brokers.</p>
                        <p>We’re all in the race, and we’re all going to continue to run it. But maybe we should remember to put on the right gear. And be sure we see the track in front of us.</p>
